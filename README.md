# Deeper-Networks-for-Image-Classification
With the non-stopping growth of deep neural networks used for image classification, a vast amount of models that achieve state-of-the-art performances have been made available for usage, however some stand out more than others. That is the case of the VGG and ResNet models. With their novel concepts they achieve remarkable performances that keep on improving with the introduction of variations of these. In this report the VGG and ResNet models are experimented with by using them for the task of image classification using two different datasets: MNIST and CIFAR10.
